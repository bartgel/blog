A passion for technique drove me towards a carreer as in software developement. For more than 20 years I used to dive deep into the code and build a strong reputation as a c, pl-sql and java developer.

These skills combined with my passion in understanding people eventual lead me to a career as a software architect. 

When I was 35 I also discovered the magical world of yoga and I got (a little bit) more spiritual. By spiritual I mean discovering myself and finding ways to constantly improve myself.

This lead to a lot of knowledge, that I would love to combine.

What you might expect is a collection of practical and usefull blogpost that will support you and let you see the power of these skills combined.
