## About me

From code wizard to yoga guru - meet the software architect with a twist!

For over two decades, I've been crafting tech masterpieces in C, PL-SQL, and Java, earning my stripes as a coding virtuoso. But here's where it gets interesting - my journey led me to embrace the art of understanding people and ascend to the realm of software architecture.

At 35, I delved into the enchanting world of yoga, adding a sprinkle of spirituality to my life. Through self-discovery and constant growth, I've amassed a wealth of knowledge waiting to be unleashed.

Dive into the fusion of tech expertise and spiritual wisdom with me. Let's create something truly exceptional together!
