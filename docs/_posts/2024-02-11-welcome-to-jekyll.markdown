## The day I decided to write a blog

It was a strange period. During covid all of us where managing one lockdown after another and still I decided to give up my amazing and secure job and move to Spain.

I did have some basic knowledge of the spanish language, but way not enough to be able to speak it fluently. So I started to listen to podcasts in Spanish. These podcasts gave me a lot of ideas and things that I started to write down in a tool called Obsidian, but basically I was sitting on a ton of notes that where gathering dust.

But why not sharing these thoughts with the rest of the world, get peoples reaction and improve my ideas. I could not resist this idea and eventually the rest is history. We will guide you through all the steps we did to start this amazing adventure in the blogging industry.


## Steps to create a blog

1. My vision board
2. Do the research
3. Define my audience
4. Choose a platform
5. Plan
6. Design


### Step 01: Create a vision board

One of the most important things is that you need to know where you are heading to.

# Setting up


You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
