## The day I decided to write a blog

In the midst of continuous lockdowns brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, I made a seemingly unconventional decision. Despite having a secure and fulfilling job, I chose to leave it all behind and relocate to Spain. 

Although I had a basic understanding of the Spanish language, fluency was still far from my reach. Determined to improve, I turned to podcasts in Spanish for guidance and inspiration. These podcasts provided me with a wealth of ideas that I eagerly captured in the note-taking tool, Obsidian. 

Over time, I realized the potential impact of sharing these thoughts with the world, receiving feedback, and refining my ideas. And so, with this irresistible idea in mind, I embarked upon an exciting adventure in the blogging industry. This article aims to outline the steps we took to begin this incredible journey.

# Setting up


You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
